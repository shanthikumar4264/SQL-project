This project focuses on analyzing music-related data using SQL to uncover trends, insights, and patterns. It involves working with datasets containing information on artists, albums, tracks, genres, and user interactions like play counts or ratings. Key tasks include data cleaning, querying to extract meaningful insights (e.g., most popular genres, top-performing artists, or frequently played tracks), and performing aggregations to summarize metrics such as average song duration or total plays per genre. The project demonstrates proficiency in SQL for data manipulation, querying, and visualization preparation.
